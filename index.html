	<div class="box">
		<div id="red">Idli Sambhar</div>
		<div class="grey">If there has been one dish that has been a true ‘game changer’ of the way south Indian food is perceived and eaten in India it has to be the humble and ubiquitous idli sambar, a dish that relies on family traditions.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="box" id="box3">
		<div id="yellow">Uttapam</div>
		<div class="grey" id="subBox3">Those who love Uttapam, is always their first choice for the discerning and they claims that it gives a simultaneous  experience of three different dishes: crispy outer layer like Dosa; insides are all soft like an Idli and cooked toppings gives you a feel of pizza. Mini Uttapams have also become very popular, usually served with sambar n coconut chutney. also wid tomato chutney or spicy green chilli & mint chutney as well.</div>
